# Linear Algebra and Calculus Projects  

Welcome to my repository! Here, I store the projects and exercises developed during my Linear Algebra and Calculus classes at university.  

## About  

This repository serves as a collection of all the work Iâ€™ve done in these courses, showcasing my learning process and the practical applications of mathematical concepts. It includes solutions to assignments, implementations of algorithms, and visualizations related to:  

- **Linear Algebra**: Topics such as matrix operations, vector spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.  
- **Calculus**: Topics such as derivatives, integrals, limits, and series.  

## Structure  

The repository is organized into two main folders:  

- `linear-algebra/`: Contains all projects and exercises related to Linear Algebra.  
- `calculus/`: Contains all projects and exercises related to Calculus.  

## Tools and Languages  

Most of the projects were developed using:  

- **Python**: For numerical computation and visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To create interactive and well-documented solutions.
